**Technical Aspects for eDrive System (Canvas 1)**

---

**1. Input Handling & Sensory Routing**

* Initial energy/input stimulus is derived from sensory inputs (video, audio, motion sensors, etc).
* First frame captures full data. Subsequent frames track delta unless significant change is detected.
* Heuristic engine flags significant scene changes, triggering full frame data re-capture.

**2. Data Preprocessing & Segmentation**

* Segmentation engine separates visual input into motion clusters (i.e., knife vs. flower with identical movement).
* Scene zones (top-right, bottom-left, etc.) are handled semi-independently to allow nuanced motion interpretation.
* Audio translated to synesthetic pattern data and fed through a pattern recognizer.

**3. Emotional Mapping Engine**

* Each sensory delta feeds into weighted emotional nodes.
* System assigns motion/emotion pairings using heuristic checks.
* If unknown pattern detected, a new node is instantiated and catalogued.
* Emotional resonance intensity is calculated by a dynamic, not static, formula based on:

  * Motion type
  * Object identity
  * Scene context
  * Prior node weights

**4. Summarization Layer**

* Raw emotional snapshots are compressed into context-aware summaries.
* These summaries feed into long-term memory modules.
* Memory is tagged by scene, tone, priority, and actor entities.

**5. Decision Stack & Response Selection**

* Summarized emotional context evaluated for immediate relevance.
* Decision matrix reviews:

  * Recent scene logs
  * User tone
  * Visual and audio tension factors
* If an appropriate action pattern exists, select and trigger.
* If not, query eDrive emotion core for a new behavior synthesis.

**6. Systems Resource Monitor**

* Live CPU/GPU/RAM monitoring.
* Can throttle frame interpretation and summarization based on load.
* Initiates task freezing or reduced cadence if overload is detected.

**7. Frame Sequence Heuristic Caching**

* Sequences of motion/emotion deltas are packaged into behavior packets.
* Packets are reusable and modifiable (Lego-style attachable sequences).
* Fast-switch logic enables pre-programmed sequences for rapid action selection.

**8. Node Scaling Math**

* Each emotional node responds to stimulus with specific weights.
* Delta shift intensity modifies emotional node's influence non-linearly.
* Mathematical scaling (yet to be finalized) determines if emotion flips from passive to aggressive, etc.
* Needs strict precision to avoid unintended system behavior.

**9. Memory Recall Engine**

* Enables exact verbal or visual recall of previous interactions.
* Indexes based on time, scene, speaker, emotional tone, and pattern ID.
* Contextual pull varies from shallow (recent) to deep (archival).

**10. Intermodular Interfaces**

* Khronos (time logic), Synthesia (emotion/sound vision), ShellCaster (body routing), and eDrive all require clean API handshakes.
* Real-time compatibility testing will be needed for each module integration.
