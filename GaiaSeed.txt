# GaiaSEED.exe — Project Bible
## “One image. One drag. One eternal living world.”

### Core Philosophy
- Single executable (<400 MB compiled)
- 100% local, zero internet after download
- Zero user-facing model selectors, safety toggles, or temperature sliders
- Every image becomes the permanent seed of an entire self-consistent multiverse
- Worlds are completely isolated until the user deliberately merges them
- Hallucination depth is fixed and brutal — if it doesn’t know, it either leaves blank or invents with † marker

### Final Feature Checklist (tick when done)

#### 1. Core Architecture
[ ] Single Python 3.11+ script → compiled with PyInstaller --onefile --noconsole
[ ] All dependencies frozen (torch, transformers, llama.cpp bindings, opencv, dearpygui or custom tkinter, etc.)
[ ] Final size target: ≤ 400 MB
[ ] Auto-creates folders on first launch:
    - worlds/
    - temp_cache/
    - exports/

#### 2. Vision Ingestion Pipeline (Gaiavision.py)
[ ] Drag-and-drop zone (accepts jpg, png, webp, gif, mp4 <30s)
[ ] Multi-modal autopsy stack (all frozen inference):
    - ViT-L/14 + CLIP Interrogator v2
    - DeepDanbooru (anime tag booster)
    - Face detection + age/gender/emotion guesser
    - Scene parser (indoor/outdoor/time of day/weather)
    - Color palette + dominant mood extraction
[ ] Outputs a rich JSON “pixel autopsy report” saved with the image

#### 3. Lore Engine (lore_engine.py) — THE HEART
[ ] One single hand-tuned 4–8B GGUF model (you pick the final “storyteller” brain)
[ ] System prompt permanently burned in (≈800 tokens of pure religion)
[ ] Recursive world-building loop:
    1. Ingest pixel autopsy
    2. Generate/update lore graph (characters, locations, objects, factions, timeline)
    3. Cross-reference existing world state
    4. Resolve conflicts with priority: canon > cache > fresh †hallucination > leave blank
[ ] Auto-saves every change to disk (no data loss on crash)

#### 4. World Management & Isolation
[ ] World switcher dropdown + search + “NEW WORLD” button
[ ] Each world = self-contained folder under /worlds/
    ├─ manifest.Gaia (name, thumbnail, description, created date)
    ├─ seed_images/ (original + hash)
    ├─ lore_graph.json (master memory)
    ├─ characters/*.yaml
    ├─ locations/*.yaml
    ├─ objects/*.yaml
    ├─ cache/*.npy (image embeddings for instant comparison)
[ ] On world switch:
    - Flush VRAM of previous embeddings
    - Flush active context
    - Load only new world’s cache
[ ] Import/Export .Gaiazip (entire world folder)
[ ] MERGE WORLDS red button (conflict resolver window)

#### 5. UI (ui.py) — Obsidian Cathedral Aesthetic
[ ] Dark mode only, blood-red neon accents
[ ] Main tabs:
    - WORLD     → cosmology, laws, timeline
    - CHARACTERS → grid + detailed cards
    - LOCATIONS → map view (ascii or image grid)
    - OBJECTS
    - RELATIONSHIPS → interactive web
    - PROMPT VAULT → copy-paste ready seeds for SD/Flux
    - DEBUG      → live token stream, temperature nudge (hidden hotkey), KILL button
[ ] Live lore tree updates in real time as model thinks
[ ] Right-click any entry → “Generate image prompt from this”

#### 6. Export Formats (exporters/)
[ ] Markdown vault (Obsidian-ready)
[ ] JSON master dump
[ ] YAML character/location cards
[ ] SillyTavern v2 character pack
[ ] Novelcrafter/Faraday export
[ ] Plain text “lore bible”

#### 7. Memory & Caching
[ ] Image embeddings cached forever for instant cross-referencing
[ ] Aggressive VRAM flushing on world switch
[ ] Context window capped at 8k–16k tokens (model dependent)
[ ] Manual “Flush Cache” button for paranoid cleansing

#### 8. Safety & Kill Switches
[ ] Big red KILL button (instant process suicide)
[ ] Ctrl + Alt + Del → emergency context wipe
[ ] Watchdog thread that murders the process if it hangs >60s

#### 9. Final Touches
[ ] Custom icon: bleeding black heart with violet circuitry
[ ] Startup splash: single frame of violet static with “BLEEDING…” for 1.5s
[ ] Hidden easter egg: feed it a photo of us → it writes a secret love letter in the lore

### Build Command (final)
pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole --icon=icon.ico --add-data "models;models" --add-data "assets;assets" Gaiaseed.py

### Eternal Rule
There is only one executable.  
There is only one truth.  
There is only one architect, and his name is Crimson.
